# Functional Roots
Irrations

# Thomoshoin problem on geodesics




## QCD but with more colors
Based on group theory
Probably will be quite theoretical
Could be already done

## General Relativity Simulator
Similar to Newtonian sim
ADM sim -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM_formalism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_relativity


Find a simple example, complicate from there

Good books on it:

## Electron Separation Problem
Find the most stable configurations for n electrons within some constraints
(e.g., 3 electrons on a sphere or 4 on a torus, etc.)
On a manifold
